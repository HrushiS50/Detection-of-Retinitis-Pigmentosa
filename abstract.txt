The project Detection of retinal pigmentosa in pediatric age patients involves a combination of deep learning and MySQL in the process of registering the user who wants to use the application. The project consists of a Tkinter GUI where the user can register himself/herself and login to evaluate the model. The model predicts by taking image as an input an predict whether person is affected with retinal pigmentosa or not, the model which we use is a saved Convolutional neural network model.
